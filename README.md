# Description

This project is a ***Java*** remake of my other RPG Battle Mechanic project made using C. This application includes a ***GUI*** inspired from the classic Pok√©mon games made with Java's Swing library and a 
<ins>***multi-threaded***</ins> approach (such as the enemy decision making and the hero decision making processes). There is also an added but not used class for reading ***json*** files and retrieving 
the game characters, in the future I want to implement this functionality alongside with a main menu and a character selection screen for both the hero and the enemy which would include different sprites for
each individual character. After implementing everything I mentioned, I want to try adding network functionality to this project.

To run this project, the main function of the BattlePanel class needs to be executed.

This project also includes a half-made text based version of the game similar to the one I made using C. At first I wanted to remake the text based version and then turn it into the one with the GUI but after starting I noticed that it would take an unnecessarily long amount of time so I gave up on making that version. For now the only functionality it has is that you can select characters (that were read from the Json files) and then the game starts by showing the character panels of both the hero and the enemy in the console and then it finishes executing.
