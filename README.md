# Description

This project is a ***Java*** remake of my other RPG Battle Mechanic project made using C. This application includes a ***GUI*** inspired from the classic Pok√©mon games made with Java's Swing library and a 
<ins>***multi-threaded***</ins> approach (such as the enemy decision making and the hero decision making processes). There is also an added but not used class for reading ***json*** files and retrieving 
the game characters, in the future I want to implement this functionality alongside with a main menu and a character selection screen for both the hero and the enemy which would include different sprites for
each individual character. After implementing everything I mentioned, I want to try adding network functionality to this project.
